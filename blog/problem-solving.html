          <div class ="divclass"><h1>When I got blocked on a problem</h1>
            The problem was a coding exercise where we had to find which door Scooby Doo is hiding behind. The exercise lacks information, and I had a hard time understanding 
            the format in which the tests were presented. Due to this, I struggled to write a progeram that correctly figured out the door Scooby was behind. I tried rubber ducking 
            and writing pseudocode, which breaks down what I need to do into steps - but it did not help. Neither did the error messages that I would see when running the code I've 
            written. It made me feel a little frustrated, but I did learn a new useful programming technique at the end of it. I also learned that being blocked still 
            frustrates me, and that I need a break before revisiting the problem.<br><br>
            <h1>When I solved a problem in an elegant way</h1>
            This was also a coding challenge - we needed to write a piece of code that returns the number you give it. If the number you give it is divisible by 3, it returns Fizz 
            instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, it returns Buzz instead the of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (like 30), then the program 
            returns FizzBuzz. To solve this, I used the rebber ducking method, where I wrote down my thought process while conversating with the piece of paper I wrote on. Basically, 
            since numbers divisible by both three and five will always be divisible by 15 (and vice versa), then I used that logic to build the program. Any number that leaves a remainder 
            of zero after being divided by 15 returns FizzBuzz.<br><br>
            <h1>Confidence in using different problem solving techniques</h1>
            From a coding perspective, I cannot say I'm very confident using any particular technique. I am aware that I need a lot more practice. That said, here are the methods: 
            <br><br><strong>Pseudocode:</strong><br> Still new to this, not as confident. 
            <br><br><strong>Trying something:</strong><br> I feel confident with this, because it is what I usually employ for work issues as well. Trial and error is my bread and butter.
            <br><br><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong><br> I enjoy this method, and feel a little confident using it. It feels more natural to me than pseudocode.
            <br><br><strong>Reading error messages:</strong><br> Reading error messages is an excellent troubleshooting tool, and I am quite confident in it pointing me in the right direction.
            <br><br><strong>Console.logging:</strong><br> Related to error messages - an excellent troubleshooting tool. I like this method and am fairly confident using it.
            <br><br><strong>Googling:</strong><br> I used this a lot. And will keep using it. Quite confident, but still need to do better navigating different answers/websites. 
            <br><br><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong><br> I don't have issues asking for help, I'm fairly confident with this. Haven't yet needed to at EDA, but definitely will when stuck.
            <br><br><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong><br> Same as above, haven't needed to.
            <br><br><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong><br> I don't do much reflection, so this is one I'm less confident in.
