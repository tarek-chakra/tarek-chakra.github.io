          <div class ="divclass"><h1>Three new things I learned about myself</h1>
            I can get frustrated when I do not find a solution to a given problem quickly. I learnt to take a breath when I'm frustrated, and a small break, then coming back and 
            attacking the problem with a fresh head. I learnt that coding principles make sense in my head, and I also learnt that sometimes I need to keep my ego in check and 
            remember that it's okay to fail.<br><br>
            <h1>Roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in programming</h1>
            It's important to have empathy in programming for multiple reasons. Empathy helps when working in groups because you can understand the thinking and emotions of your 
            peers and this allows you to work better with them. It also allows for better product development due to understanding the needs and wants of end-clients. When your values 
            are in tune with the team's values, it makes collaboration much easier. Self-awareness helps keep one grounded, and helps keep communications in check, and ego in 
            check when dealing with others.

            <h1>Surprises and challenging aspects of core learning</h1>
            Sticking to the timing for the core learning was a bit of a challenge - I tended to keep that until the end, especially because I, as a person, tend to focus much 
            more on the analytical side of things. The core material had concepts I was already aware of, so it was mainly a challenge sticking to and uploading reflections.
            <br><br>
            <h1>Why does EDA spend so much time on core?</h1>
            Mindfulness and knowledge of self helps when it comes to working collaboratively. It's important to be a person that people like being around and want to work with, 
            and it is as important to be someone who can identify your own thought patterns and emotions, and keep things in check in order to avoid pitfalls that you're prone to 
            and avoid burnout or overwhelm. Additionally, Core helps train EQ and elevate it, which is correlated to personal and professional success.            
            <br><br>
            <h1>Did core feel like a waste of time?</h1>
            Reflections to me, specifically, did feel a little like a waste of time. I tended to rush through them and do them in the end, after everything else was completed. That 
            said, I understand the value of knowing these concepts, and working by reflecting on things that were done and how one would do them better. Personally, I learn more by 
            doing, and reflecting does not tend to add much value to my learning experience - that's just my personal perspective. I didn't feel like things were challenging or demanding 
            enough at this stage for me to retrospectively look into every element that I've worked on and write about it.
