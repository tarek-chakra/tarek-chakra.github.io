            At the moment, I'm working full-time as a technical lead in a subscription payments company. My long-term goal would be to create my own software and build a software company from the ground up

            <h1>Skills I would Like to Develop at EDA</h1>
            First and foremost, I'd like to develop collaborative working skills. At my job, I work more in an individual and decisive role, and less as part of a team. I would like to better understand and be able to work with the developers, and other teammates.<br><br>
            I'd also like to learn how to switch on and switch off - mainly because my modus operandi is 'Always On'.
            <br><br>Finally, I'd like to also learn some organizational skills - crucial when working in a team on a complex project.
