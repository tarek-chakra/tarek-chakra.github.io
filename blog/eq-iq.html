          <div class ="divclass"><h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
            Emotional intelligence is an abstract measure of one's ability to manage and control their own emotions, as well as perceive the emotions of other people<br><br>
            <h1>Difference between EQ and IQ</h1>
            IQ is a measure of one's intelligence pertaining to analytical ability and problem solving using logical thinking. It does not measure all types of intelligence (like music intelligence, spatial intelligence, kinetic intelligence) and only focuses on analytical ability. EQ is different in that it does not account for analytical intelligence or logical thinking, and instead only focuses on emotions.

            <h1>Importance of EQ</h1>
            Studies have shown that EQ is positively correlated mental well-being and professional success. People with high EQ are better able to manage their emotions, are liked by their peers/colleagues, and live happier, more fulfilled lives. As such, working on improving EQ is important and worthwhile.
